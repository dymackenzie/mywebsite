Hi. I have a question for you.
  
**What does it mean to live a full life?**

328 days ago I asked the same question in my journal.

And 328 days later, I don’t think I can answer this question for you.

How do you describe the smell of roses or the difference between the same musical note played on the piano and tuba? You can’t, at least not fully. You would have to give a rose to smell or play the same note to explain it.

This is known as **qualia**, the idea that no scientific description will ever capture the actual experience.

The question “what does it mean to live a full life?” is ultimately about qualia. I can tell you what I think about it, but in the end, the way *you* answer it is by living it out.

Well, let me start off with what I thought was a full life.

I thought a full life meant *people*. I thought it was having friends who reached out to you and who made you laugh so hard your tummy hurts and smile so wide your cheeks ache. I thought it was a community where you found belonging and understanding. I thought it was a thriving social circle, the ones where, you know, you all go on fun road trips and you do all kinds of stupid things together and you care so deeply for all of them. Friends who give warm hugs and even warmer memories.

Then I thought a full life meant *experiences*. I thought it was making memories that you’d tell your kids one day. Like parking at a library to backpack the top of Whistler Peak. Or running a race in a silly little caterpillar costume. And I can’t even count how many lakes I’ve swam in, or sunsets I’ve seen, or trails I’ve hiked. I thought it was sitting and staring at the night sky, or chasing those moments that you wish would never end. I thought it was experiencing more singing around campfires, more silence in the mountains, more adrenaline, more fun, more adventure.

And then I thought a full life meant *independence*. I thought it was finding joy in your hobbies, and finding joy in trying new things, and being able to miss out on certain things because people’s validation doesn’t mean as much anymore. I thought it was being okay with being a beginner and okay with putting yourself out there without guarantees. I thought it was knowing how to enjoy your own company or being able to sit with yourself without any distractions.

But Mackenzie, isn’t that what a full life looks like?

> All is vanity,” says the Preacher. “There is nothing new under the sun.

None of those things I mentioned are bad. In fact, they are beautiful things meant to be loved, and cherished, and enjoyed. But on their own, they can never stay *quite* full. Because, you know, what if maybe life isn’t just about collecting more and looking for the next best thing. Maybe it’s about finding something that lasts.

328 days ago I asked the question, “What does it mean to live a full life?” And 328 days later, here’s what I come to believe: living a full life is living for a God who loves you.

I have one life, and it will soon be past, but I will try my very best to live for him, because *that* will last.

I will ask it again: what does it mean *for you* to live a full life? It’s a question of **qualia**, so you won’t be able to understand the answer here. So go and live your life, but be honest to yourself. And maybe one day when you are still searching even after living through everything, you’ll understand what I meant. Not because of what I said, but because you lived it.

> Only one life, 'twill soon be past, Only what's done for Christ will last.
